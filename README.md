# Jamcraft, the game

## About
This is the source code for my (unfinished) entry to the 7-day [Jamcraft game jam](https://itch.io/jam/jamcraft) game jam; the theme was "Companion". The released game can be [found on itch.io](https://meseta.itch.io/jamcraft-the-game)

The jam was an opportunity for me to explore a few topics:
* Complex inventory systems
* Crafting

I'm now open-sourcing the code for educational purposes.
